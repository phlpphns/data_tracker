This is a data tracker app that is intended to be flexible both in terms of adaptability by a user in a folder "user_scripts" and also in defining the GUI layout by independent components.
Currently, it is structured as a tkinter gui. To make the design less object oriented, a dictionary that handles global variables and GUI elements is employed.

It is still actively worked upon and not yet ready to be shipped widely.

Currently based on a pandas data frame as standardized format. Could also be a in memory hdf5 or depending on the chosen data loadung and presentation format.
